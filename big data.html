            <p>The term big data has been in use since the 1990s, with some giving credit to John Mashey for
                popularizing the term.
                Big data usually includes data sets with sizes beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to
                capture, curate, manage, and process data within a tolerable elapsed time.
                Big data philosophy encompasses unstructured, semi-structured and structured data, however the main
                focus is on unstructured data.

                The type and nature of the data. The earlier technologies like RDBMSs were capable to handle structured
                data efficiently and effectively. However, the change in type and nature from structured to
                semi-structured or unstructured challenged the existing tools and technologies. The big data
                technologies evolved with the prime intention to capture, store, and process the semi-structured and
                unstructured (variety) data generated with high speed (velocity), and huge in size (volume). Later,
                these tools and technologies were explored and used for handling structured data also but preferable for
                storage. Eventually, the processing of structured data was still kept as optional, either using big data
                or traditional RDBMSs. This helps in analyzing data towards effective usage of the hidden insights
                exposed from the data collected via social media, log files, sensors, etc. Big data draws from text,
                images, audio, video; plus it completes missing pieces through data fusion.

            <p>Big data repositories have existed in many forms, often built by corporations with a special need.
                Commercial vendors historically offered parallel database management systems for big data beginning in
                the 1990s. For many years, WinterCorp published the largest database report.</p>

            <p>Big data has increased the demand of information management specialists so much so that Software AG,
                Oracle Corporation, IBM, Microsoft, SAP, EMC, HP, and Dell have spent more than $15 billion on software
                firms specializing in data management and analytics. In 2010, this industry was worth more than $100
                billion and was growing at almost 10 percent a year: about twice as fast as the software business as a
                whole.</p>

                Research on the effective usage of information and communication technologies for development (also
                known as "ICT4D") suggests that big data technology can make important contributions but also present
                unique challenges to international development.
                Advancements in big data analysis offer cost-effective opportunities to improve decision-making in
                critical development areas such as health care, employment, economic productivity, crime, security, and
                natural disaster and resource management.[58][59][60] Additionally, user-generated data offers new
                opportunities to give the unheard a voice
                However, longstanding challenges for developing regions such as inadequate technological infrastructure
                and economic and human resource scarcity exacerbate existing concerns with big data such as privacy,
                imperfect methodology, and interoperability issues.[58] The challenge of "big data for development"
                is currently evolving toward the application of this data through machine learning, known as "artificial
                intelligence for development (AI4D).
